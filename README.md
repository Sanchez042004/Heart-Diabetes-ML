# Detecting Heart Disease & Diabetes with Machine Learning

Machine learning presents an extraordinary opportunity to elevate healthcare standards by enabling early disease detection. By developing precise models for identifying heart disease and diabetes, we can initiate timely interventions, personalized treatment plans, and proactively manage health concerns.

## Data Collection

Medical records and health databases were searched for patient data and outcomes. The data collected includes patient data and outcomes, and the quantity of data is sufficient to adequately test the model.

## Data Preprocessing

Missing values and irrelevant data were removed during preprocessing. Normalization was applied to ensure uniform data scalability, and data was converted to numerical format for successful tracking.

## Data Splitting

The dataset was split for model testing and training. A portion of the dataset was used for training the model, and another portion was used for evaluation. Typically, 70-80% of the data was used for training and 20-30% for testing.

## Model Selection

Appropriate algorithms for decision trees and logistic regression were chosen. Different models were tested for a better fit.

## Disease Detection

Models relying on new data were utilized for diagnosis, identifying heart diseases or diabetes.

## Main Causes of Heart Disease & Diabetes

- **High Blood Pressure:** Elevated blood pressure puts strain on the heart and blood vessels, increasing the risk of coronary artery disease and heart attacks.
  
- **High Cholesterol:** Elevated levels of LDL cholesterol can lead to the buildup of plaque in the arteries, narrowing blood flow and increasing the risk of heart disease.
  
- **Obesity:** Obesity contributes to diabetes by promoting insulin resistance, where cells become less responsive to insulin signals, leading to elevated blood sugar levels. Over time, the pancreas may struggle to produce enough insulin to compensate, resulting in type 2 diabetes.

## Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Scikit Learn
